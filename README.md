# HelpDesk
On the main page of the app, end users of the service can submit support ticket requests. Necessary fields include name, email and a description of the problem they are experiencing.

On a separate page, the backend admin panel, support staff can see a list summary of each ticket, including status. Support staff can drill down into the ticket to access a detailed description and respond to any ticket, as well as update the status of the ticket. Possible statuses are “new”, “in progress”, and “resolved”.
